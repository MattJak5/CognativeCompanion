# Care App Project Plan

## Purpose
A simple, user-friendly web app to support elderly users or those with early dementia by helping with day-to-day tasks, while also assisting caregivers and family members with organization and communication.

---

## Target Users
- Elderly people or individuals with memory challenges
- Family caregivers
- Professional caregivers (with multiple patients)
- Care homes (future consideration)

---

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity first** for both patient and caregiver
- **Accessibility** for older users (UI clarity, responsive, lightweight)
- **Affordability** — runs on old tablets via PWA
- **Scalable design** to allow feature growth
- **Learning-focused** — demonstrate full-stack skills

---

## Roadmap

---

## Feedback & Research Strategy
- Talk to caregivers and family (informal interviews)
- Join forums for dementia/caregiving
- Set up a landing page with a feedback form
- Document learnings & improvements in blog

---

## Blog Plan
- **Post 1**: Project intro — what, why, roadmap
- **Post 2+**: MVP progress posts (planning, tech stack, decisions)
- Share to: Dev.to, Hashnode, GitHub Pages (later)

---

## Tech Stack (To Be Confirmed)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (maybe Tailwind), later React
- Backend: Ruby on Rails (early), maybe move to Node later
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: Render / Fly.io / Netlify (for frontend)
- PWA support: Web manifest + service worker

---

## Feature Ideas Bank
- [ ] Checklist UI for patient
- [ ] Medication reminders
- [ ] Emergency contact quick dial
- [ ] Speech-to-text journal

## Notes
- Keep MVP tight — usability and clarity > feature overload
- Design with real-world constraints in mind
- Blog and project planning = part of your portfolio
